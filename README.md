# mdiary
An easy to use terminal diary application (WIP). It's a summer project, so don't expect too much.

## Using the application

Run

```
python main.py
```

and the rest is (hopefully) apparent. To get more information run

```
python main.py --help
```

## Dependencies

This application requires a few python libraries.

* urwid
* sqlalchemy
* cryptography

## I (still) need to
* think of a catchy name.
* add the key security option.
* etc.
